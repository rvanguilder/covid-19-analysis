# covid-19-analysis

This is a repo that holds various bash commands that analyze data from the New York Times Covid-19-Data set. These are amaturish commands that I developed to increase my skills at using Linux/GNU tools to analyze datasets.

TODO:
 - Add percentage and absolute change values for each day
 - This was written against the mawk verions of awk.  Need to test against gawk.
 - Make commands more readable.  Consider an awk file and bash scripts.
 - Account for screen height and width
 - Parameterize commands to allow number of states output and desired output columns
