# covid-19-analysis

This is a repo that holds various bash commands that analyze data from the New York Times Covid-19-Data set. These are amaturish commands that I developed to increase my skills at using Linux/GNU tools to analyze datasets.

TODO:
 - Add nytimes/covid-19 repo as a git submodule
 - Add percentage and absolute change values for each day
